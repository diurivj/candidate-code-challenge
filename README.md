# Candidate Code Challenge

## Instructions

### Goal

Build a grid view of artworks similar to: [https://superrare.co/market](https://superrare.co/market).

### Scenarios

The following are scenarios describing how the feature you are building will be used.

1. Kathy wants to browse through the very cool art on SuperRare but would prefer to see it in a grid, 3 across.
1. While browsing, Jimmy wants to see the name, current owner and creator of the artwork as well as the artwork itself.
1. Kyle looks at the artworks on his phone and finds the site responsive; he sees 1 artwork at a time.
1. EXTRA: An filters artworks by name.

### Non-goals

* Pagination
* Displaying bid or sell orders.

### Implementation Details

Implementation details are up to you. This repo is a fresh `create-react-app` install. Please use this or an ejected version and avoid switching to another framework such as `Vue.js` or `Next.js`.

#### Data source

Please use [SuperRare's API](https://SuperRare.co/sr-json/docs/) as your data source. Restrict the artwork categories to: `artwork` and `artwork-v2`
